In this environment, the agent navigates a 3x3 grid, trying to move from a starting position to a goal position. The agent receives rewards for reaching the goal and negative penalties for moving into an obstacle. The task is to learn an optimal policy (best sequence of actions) for reaching the goal with the highest cumulative reward.
